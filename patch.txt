__**Tomi Release Update V.1.8 â€“ March 24th, 2019**__

Hey guys, back with another Tomi update! Thanks for using the bot! :heart:
It's been a while since I last updated Tomi, but with the new patch comes new things!

**=== Changes === **

:radio_button: *New* Robe commands, t!spirit, t!fury, and t!fall are here!

:radio_button: I'm still working on updating the wiki with the new info, but most of the relics as of today should be searchable now!

:radio_button: It was fun, but the t!countdown command is now gone...
